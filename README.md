Hydro-Nexus is an innovative agricultural system designed to help users grow exotic crops efficiently by combining the benefits of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) and hydroponics. The project focuses on using a specially engineered, soilless buffer medium in modular grow bags, managed with advanced IoT sensors and AI automation for real-time monitoring and adaptive control.

Key Features
Custom Buffer Medium: Uses a unique mix of cocopeat, perlite, biochar, and recycled polymer beads for optimal moisture, aeration, and microbial support, greatly reducing root rot and boosting plant health.

Precision Irrigation: Surface-laid drip pipelines and microtubes deliver water and nutrients directly to plant roots, using up to 80% less water than traditional farming.

Smart Automation: AI algorithms and smart sensors track moisture, pH, temperature, nutrients, and light in real time, and automatically adjust irrigation and dosing for optimal crop growth.

Advanced Technologies: Integrates plasma-activated water treatments and full-spectrum LED lighting to improve nutrient uptake, plant immunity, and crop quality.

Modular Grow Bags: Enables flexible, space-efficient cultivation for a wide range of exotic and compact crops, suitable for urban farms and controlled environments.

Benefits
Faster crop growth cycles, higher yields, and improved nutritional quality.

Highly efficient use of water and nutrients, reducing waste and environmental impact.

Lower risk of root and fungal diseases, thanks to optimal aeration and microbial habitats.

Cloud-based dashboard for remote management and monitoring.

Hydro-Nexus makes it easy for both hobbyists and professional growers to adopt sustainable, high-tech crop cultivation with minimal resource use and maximum output.
