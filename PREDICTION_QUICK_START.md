## üî¨ Analysis Features

### What the AI Detects:
‚úÖ **Fungal Diseases** - Leaf spot, mildew, rust, blight  
‚úÖ **Bacterial Infections** - Leaf spot, soft rot, canker  
‚úÖ **Viral Diseases** - Mosaic, leaf curl, yellowing  
‚úÖ **Nutrient Deficiencies** - N, P, K, Fe, Mg deficiency  
‚úÖ **Environmental Stress** - Water, heat, light damage  
‚úÖ **Pest Damage** - Insect feeding, mechanical injury  

### Confidence Scoring:
- **0.9-1.0** - Very High (90-100%)
- **0.7-0.9** - High (70-90%)
- **0.5-0.7** - Medium (50-70%)
- **0.0-0.5** - Low (<50%)

### Severity Levels:
- üü¢ **Healthy** - No disease detected
- üü° **Low** - Early stage, easy treatment
- üü† **Medium** - Moderate intervention needed
- üî¥ **High** - Significant treatment required
- üî¥ **Critical** - Immediate action needed

## üéØ QBM-HydroNet Recommendations

The AI provides system-specific suggestions:

### For Fungal Diseases:
- Apply high-dose PAW for sterilization
- Adjust substrate biochar for pH control
- Enhance AMF colonization for immunity

### For Nutrient Deficiencies:
- Adjust nutrient solution EC levels
- Check pH balance (optimal: 5.5-6.5)
- Verify PAW dosing schedule

### For Environmental Stress:
- Monitor substrate moisture (70-80%)
- Adjust LED lighting intensity
- Check air circulation and humidity

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Healthy Plant ‚úÖ
**Upload:** Clear image of healthy green leaves  
**Expected Result:**
- `diseaseDetected: false`
- Confidence >0.85
- Maintenance recommendations
- Positive health status

### Test 2: Leaf Spot Disease üü°
**Upload:** Leaves with brown/black spots  
**Expected Result:**
- `diseaseDetected: true`
- Disease name: "Leaf Spot" or specific type
- Severity: low/medium
- Fungicide or PAW treatment recommendations

### Test 3: Nutrient Deficiency üü†
**Upload:** Yellowing leaves (chlorosis)  
**Expected Result:**
- `diseaseDetected: true`
- Disease name: "Iron/Nitrogen Deficiency"
- Nutrient adjustment recommendations
- pH check suggestions

### Test 4: Severe Blight üî¥
**Upload:** Wilted, brown, dying leaves  
**Expected Result:**
- `diseaseDetected: true`
- Disease name: "Late Blight" or "Bacterial Wilt"

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "No image file provided"
**Fix:** Select a file before clicking Analyze

### ‚ùå "Invalid file type"
**Fix:** Use PNG, JPG, JPEG, or WEBP format

### ‚ùå "AI service configuration error"
**Fix:** Verify `.env.local` has `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Low confidence scores
**Fix:** 
- Use clear, well-lit images
- Focus on affected areas
- Avoid blurry photos
- Try different angles

### ‚è±Ô∏è Analysis taking too long
**Fix:**
- Check internet connection
- Reduce image size (<5MB)
- Refresh and try again
