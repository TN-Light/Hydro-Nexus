# ESP32 HTTPS Connection to Vercel - Complete Guide

## üî¥ Problem Identified

**Root Cause**: Your ESP32 was trying to connect using HTTP (unencrypted), but Vercel only serves HTTPS (encrypted). The ESP32 couldn't establish SSL/TLS connections without proper certificate configuration.

### Why It Worked Locally But Not on Vercel

- **Local (`http://localhost:3000`)**: No encryption needed ‚úÖ
- **Vercel (`https://qbm-hydronet.vercel.app`)**: Requires SSL/TLS certificates ‚ùå

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. ESP32 Code Changes

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Added `WiFiClientSecure.h` library for HTTPS support
- ‚úÖ Included Google Trust Services Root CA certificate (valid until 2036)
- ‚úÖ Updated `sendSensorData()` to use `WiFiClientSecure` with certificate validation
- ‚úÖ Updated `checkForCommands()` to use `WiFiClientSecure`
- ‚úÖ Added `testHTTPSConnection()` function to verify HTTPS on startup
- ‚úÖ Increased timeouts for HTTPS (15s for data send, 10s for commands)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error logging with detailed HTTPS error messages

### 2. Backend API Changes

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Case-insensitive header handling (`x-api-key` or `X-API-Key`)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging with emoji indicators for easier debugging
- ‚úÖ Added `success` field to all responses
- ‚úÖ Improved GET endpoint for connectivity testing
- ‚úÖ Better error messages with specific error details

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: Certificate Verification Failed

**Serial Output:**
```
‚úó HTTPS failed: certificate verify failed
```

**Solution:**
The root CA certificate might be outdated. The certificate in the code is valid until 2036, but if you see this:

1. Check your ESP32's date/time (might be set to 1970)
2. Try adding time sync code:
```cpp
configTime(0, 0, "pool.ntp.org", "time.nist.gov");
```

### Problem 2: Connection Timeout

**Serial Output:**
```
‚úó Failed: connection timeout
```

**Possible Causes:**
- Weak WiFi signal (check RSSI, should be > -70 dBm)
- Firewall blocking outbound HTTPS
- Vercel temporarily down

**Solution:**
```cpp
// Check WiFi signal strength
Serial.println(WiFi.RSSI()); // Should be > -70

// Try reconnecting
connectToWiFi();
```

### Problem 3: HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)

**Serial Output:**
```
‚ö† HTTP 401
Response: {"error":"Invalid API key","success":false}
```

**Solution:**
Verify API key in database:
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM api_keys WHERE device_id = 'grow-bag-1';

-- If no result, insert the key:
INSERT INTO api_keys (device_id, api_key, is_active)
VALUES ('grow-bag-1', 'esp32_grow_bag_1_key_2024_secure', true);
```

### Problem 4: HTTP 400 (Bad Request)

**Serial Output:**
```
‚ö† HTTP 400
Response: {"error":"Missing required sensor fields","success":false}
```

**Solution:**
Check sensor data in Serial Monitor. Ensure all these fields exist:
- `room_temp`
- `humidity`
- `ph`
- `ec`
- `substrate_moisture`

### Problem 5: Can't Create Secure Client

**Serial Output:**
```
‚ùå Failed to create secure client
```

**Solution:**
ESP32 ran out of memory. Reduce memory usage:
```cpp
// In sendSensorData(), delete client immediately after use
delete client; // Already in code ‚úì
```

## üìä Check Vercel Logs

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/your-project
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Click latest deployment
4. Click "Functions" tab
5. Look for logs from `/api/sensors/ingest`

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# View live logs
vercel logs --follow
```

**What to Look For:**
```
‚úÖ Good logs:
üîë API Key received: esp32_grow...
‚úÖ Device authenticated: grow-bag-1
üìä Sensor data received: {...}
‚úÖ Data stored successfully. Reading ID: 123

‚ùå Bad logs:
‚ùå No API key provided
‚ùå Invalid API key: esp32_grow...
‚ùå Error processing ESP32 data: ...
```

## üß™ Manual API Testing

### Test 1: Check API Connectivity

```powershell
# Test GET endpoint (connectivity check)
curl -X GET "https://qbm-hydronet.vercel.app/api/sensors/ingest" `
  -H "x-api-key: esp32_grow_bag_1_key_2024_secure"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "online",
  "device_id": "grow-bag-1",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T...",
  "message": "API endpoint ready",
  "success": true
}
```

### Test 2: Send Test Data

```powershell
curl -X POST "https://qbm-hydronet.vercel.app/api/sensors/ingest" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -H "x-api-key: esp32_grow_bag_1_key_2024_secure" `
  -d '{
    "device_id": "grow-bag-1",
    "room_temp": 25.5,
    "humidity": 65,
    "water_temp": 22.0,
    "ph": 6.2,
    "ec": 1.5,
    "tds_ppm": 750,
    "substrate_moisture": 70,
    "water_level_status": "Adequate"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "reading_id": 123,
  "device_id": "grow-bag-1",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T...",
  "message": "Sensor data stored successfully"
}
```

## üîê Security Notes

### Certificate Expiration
- **Current Certificate Expires**: June 22, 2036
- **Action Required in 2036**: Update the `root_ca` variable with new certificate

### Getting New Certificate
When the certificate expires, get new one:
```bash
# Get Vercel's certificate chain
echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect qbm-hydronet.vercel.app:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -text
```

### API Key Security
- ‚úÖ API key is validated on every request
- ‚úÖ Keys can be disabled in database
- ‚úÖ Keys have expiration support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't commit API keys to public repos

---

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Serial Monitor** - Look for specific error codes
2. **Check Vercel Logs** - Look for backend errors
3. **Verify Database** - Ensure API key exists and is active
4. **Test Manually** - Use curl commands above to isolate issue
5. **Check Certificate** - Ensure it hasn't expired (valid until 2036)
