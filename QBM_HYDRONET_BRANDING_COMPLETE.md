# üöÄ QBM-HydroNet Branding Complete!

## ‚úÖ What Was Updated

I've successfully transformed the voice assistant to reflect your **QBM-HydroNet** (Quantum/Plasma-driven, Bio-integrated, Machine-managed Hydroponic Network) project instead of generic "Hydro-Nexus" terminology.

---

## üéØ Changes Made

### 1. **Voice Assistant UI** (`components/jarvis-assistant.tsx`)

#### Dialog Header
- **Before**: "Your intelligent hydroponic system companion"
- **After**: **"QBM-HydroNet Intelligent Control System"**

#### Quick Action Cards
- **Card 1 (Before)**: "Check moisture" ‚Üí "View all grow bags"
- **Card 1 (After)**: **"PAW status"** ‚Üí **"Check plasma activation"**

- **Card 2 (Before)**: "System status" ‚Üí "Analyze conditions"
- **Card 2 (After)**: **"AMF network"** ‚Üí **"Monitor colonization"**

#### Help Text
- **Before**: "Ask me about temperature, humidity, moisture levels, or to control pumps and nutrients"
- **After**: **"Ask about PAW dosing, AMF colonization, substrate conditions, or to control the bioregenerative system"**

---

### 2. **AI Agent Logic** (`agent.ts`)

#### System Description
Updated QubitAssistant personality to reflect advanced bioregenerative features:

```typescript
"You are Qubit, the AI intelligence managing the QBM-HydroNet 
(Quantum/Plasma-driven, Bio-integrated, Machine-managed Hydroponic Network) 
- an advanced bioregenerative cultivation system."
```

#### Enhanced Capabilities
Qubit now understands and references:
- ‚úÖ **Plasma-Activated Water (PAW)** generation and dosing protocols
- ‚úÖ **Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF)** network health monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Engineered substrate** conditions (cocopeat-biochar-perlite)
- ‚úÖ **Bioregenerative ecosystem** management
- ‚úÖ **Dose-dependent PAW phases** (sterilization ‚Üí stimulation ‚Üí maintenance)

#### Scientific Communication Style
Qubit now:
- Uses technical terminology: PAW, AMF, RONS, substrate CEC, symbiotic network
- Explains biological rationale (e.g., "to protect AMF colonization")
- Prioritizes biological health over pure chemical metrics
- References the living ecosystem nature of the system

#### Updated Optimal Ranges Context
Added QBM-HydroNet specific context:
```typescript
- Temperature: 20-25¬∞C (for AMF activity)
- Humidity: 60-80% (prevents substrate desiccation)
- pH: 5.5-6.5 (balances PAW acidity and nutrient availability)
- EC: 1.0-2.5 mS/cm (maintains substrate CEC buffering)
- Substrate moisture: 65-85% (optimal for capillary action)
- PAW dosing phases: High ‚Üí Low ‚Üí Standard
```

#### Greeting Message
- **Before**: "all Hydro-Nexus systems are online"
- **After**: **"the QBM-HydroNet bioregenerative system is online"**

## üß¨ Key Terminology Now Used

### Scientific Terms Qubit Understands:
1. **PAW (Plasma-Activated Water)** - Nitrogen-rich water with RONS for dual fertilization/sterilization
2. **AMF (Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi)** - Beneficial fungi forming symbiotic root networks
3. **RONS** - Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species in PAW
4. **Substrate CEC** - Cation Exchange Capacity of the biochar-cocopeat-perlite mix
5. **Bioregenerative system** - Self-sustaining biological ecosystem
6. **Symbiotic network** - Plant-fungal partnership
7. **Substrate microbiome** - Living microbial community in growing medium
8. **PAW phases** - Sterilization (high dose) ‚Üí AMF stimulation (low dose) ‚Üí Maintenance

### System Components Qubit References:
- Subsurface Drip Irrigation (SDI)
- 3D-printed polymer lattice (space adaptation)
- Capillary fluidics (microgravity water delivery)
- PARC (Plasma-Activated Resource Conversion)
- BIM (Bio-Integrated Microbiome)

---

## üé≠ New Personality Profile

### Before: Generic Hydroponic Assistant
- Basic sensor monitoring
- Simple irrigation control
- Generic advice

### After: QBM-HydroNet Digital Biologist
- **Bio-aware**: Understands living ecosystem dynamics
- **Phase-conscious**: Tracks PAW dosing phases (sterilization ‚Üí stimulation ‚Üí maintenance)
- **Scientifically precise**: Uses proper terminology (AMF colonization, substrate CEC)
- **Predictive**: Monitors biological health indicators
- **Resource-aware**: Understands ISRU and nutrient cycling
- **Space-ready**: Aware of terrestrial vs. space adaptations

---

## üó£Ô∏è Example Conversations

### User: "What's the PAW status?"
**Qubit Response**: "The plasma activation system is currently in maintenance phase, delivering low-dose PAW to support AMF colonization. RONS concentration is optimal at 15 ¬µM H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ. The symbiotic network remains healthy."

### User: "Check AMF colonization"
**Qubit Response**: "AMF colonization is progressing well. Root zone conditions are favorable with substrate moisture at 72% and pH at 6.1‚Äîideal for arbuscular formation. The fungal network is enhancing phosphate uptake across all grow bags."

### User: "Is the bioregenerative system stable?"
**Qubit Response**: "Yes, sir. All bioregenerative indicators are within optimal range. The substrate microbiome is active, PAW dosing is on schedule, and environmental parameters support healthy symbiotic function. No interventions needed."
